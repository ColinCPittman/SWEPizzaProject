This project is mainly focused on practicing principles of Software Enineerings such as planning, coordinating, documenting, scheduling, monitoring and adjusting.

The final deliverable is a prototype for the fictional client demonstrating the login, menu, and order taking process only. Though for the majority of the semester we planned out the entire system to support customer and employee use, order checkout, deliveries, account management, and more.
